# Illumination-Resilient Lane Detection by Threshold Self-Adjustment Using Newton-Based Extremum Seeking

This project uses extremum seeking (ES) method for lane detection tasks. Lane detection is performed in the hue/saturation/value (HSV) color space, without the need of edge-detection algorithms, filters, or post-processing. This method is based entirely on the color information of lane marks, and ES is introduced to deal with the illumination variation. For detailed problem formulation and ES explanation, we refer the reader to read our paper.

## Paper

For a full description of the algorithm itself and the lane detection resuls from both a simulation environment and a harware implementation, please refer to the paper.

## Primary Contributor

The primary contributor is Yujing "Bryant" Zhou, an incoming Ph.D. student at Princeton University. If you have specific questions about this repository, please post an issue.

## Language

MATLAB and Simulink are primarily used for this project.

The [QUARC](https://www.quanser.com/products/quarc-real-time-control-software/) real-time control software is required to run the Simulink files for simulation tests.

A scaled car developed by Quanser, named [QCar](https://www.quanser.com/products/qcar/), is required to run the hardware tests.
